Graph theory provides essential tools for addressing a wide range of complex problems, and one of the most fundamental challenges within this field is the \textbf{Maximum Matching} problem. In its simplest form, this problem asks us to find the largest set of edges in a graph such that no two edges share a vertex. The maximum matching problem has far-reaching applications, including network design, resource allocation, and scheduling. This book is dedicated to understanding the algorithms and techniques that solve this problem, as well as exploring its variations and related concepts in graph theory.
