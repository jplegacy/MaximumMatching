  abstract = {The stable marriage problem is a classical matching problem introduced by Gale and Shapley. It is known that for any instance, there exists a solution, and there is a polynomial time algorithm to find one. However, the matching obtained by this algorithm is man-optimal, that is, the matching is favorable for men but unfavorable for women, (or, if we exchange the roles of men and women, the resulting matching is woman-optimal). The sex-equal stable marriage problem, posed by Gusfield and Irving, seeks a stable matching “fair” for both genders. Specifically it seeks a stable matching with the property that the sum of the men's scores is as close as possible to that of the women's. This problem is known to be strongly NP-hard. In this paper, we give a polynomial time algorithm for finding a near optimal solution for the sex-equal stable marriage problem.},

  abstract  = {by V skew-symmetric matrix, called the Tutte matrix, associated with a simple graph $G=(V,E)$. He associates an indeterminate with each edge, then defines the matrix elements based on whether the edge exists or not. The rank of the Tutte matrix is exactly twice the size of a maximum matching of $G$. Using linear algebra and ideas from the Gallai–Edmonds decomposition, we describe a very simple yet efficient algorithm that replaces the indeterminates with constants without losing rank. Hence, by computing the rank of the resulting matrix, we can efficiently compute the size of a maximum matching of a graph.}
