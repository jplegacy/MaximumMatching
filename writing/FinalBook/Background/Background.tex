In the previous chapter, we were briefly introduced to the maximum matching problem. To fully understand the intricacies of this problem and the multitude of algorithms that can solve it, it is essential to first grasp the underlying concepts in graph theory and computational complexity. By exploring these foundational concepts, we can better understand how to approach the maximum matching problem across different graph types and develop effective algorithms for its solution.
