This is a template for making LaTeX posters for CSC 498 and 499.
Feel free to send me suggestions or fixes for this template.

Files:
+ poster.tex
+ poster.bib
+ beamerposter.sty
+ beamerthemeconfposter.sty
+ Makefile
+ README
+ figs/uc_logo.eps
+ figs/cs_logo.png
+ figs/science_montage.png
+ figs/bats.jpg
+ figs/PUT_YOUR_PHOTO_HERE.png

Build Requirements:
+ latex
+ make
+ latexmk
Note: CSC lab machines have all of this software.

Build Instructions:
+ In a terminal navigate to this directory.
+ Run the command make
+ The compiled poster is prepared in poster.pdf.

I believe it is also possible to use this template with cloud services
like Overleaf, but this has not been verified.


Tips:

+ Completely fill in the content of your poster before messing around
  with formatting.

+ Replace PUT_YOUR_PHOTO_HERE.png with an actual photo of you.

+ The Internet has all manner of helpful LaTeX and beamer poster
  information.

+ The template is just an example you can iterate on it as much or as
  little as you like.  However, avoid using a colored background over
  large portions of your poster.

+ beamerthemeconfposter.sty sets most of the major style options.
  It's basically a .CSS file for your poster. You can change colors,
  fonts, or margins there.

+ Be careful with images, they can become distorted or pixellated when
  rendered on a poster.  It's better to draw using vector graphics
  like the Union College logo, and the tikz example in the poster.
  These can be scaled without the same distortion.
